PyQChem is a Python module designed for an intuitive manipulation of
Q-Chem input and output files. It was written with special focus on
the features of IPython such as tab completion and easy access to
help docstrings via the question mark operator. 

To use pyQChem in your Python environment you have to put this folder
in the directory of your PYTHONPATH variable. On Unix/Max, if this
variable is not set, add the following line to your .bash_profile:

export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_your_folder>

Two IPython notebooks in html format are provided as an introduction
to inputfile handling and outputfile parsing.
